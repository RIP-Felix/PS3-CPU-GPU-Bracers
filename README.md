# PS3-CPU-GPU-Bracers
3D models to place under the PlayStation 3's CPU/GPU backplate and keep the motherboard flat so it doesn't deform under the die. 
This can be used to restor coplanrity (flatness) under the die to restore contact between the Die and IHS using what little existing thermal paste exists. This is a temporary solution to an overheating PS3 without the need to delid. It is why SONY used them on refirbished unity. To get out of having to delid and reglu the IHS back on. Even though the paste on the die is worn out and will fail again (who knows how soon), SONY's refirbishment centers do not delid. That's just not how they conduct repairs. They would have had to replace the CPU entirely, which is a difficult and expensive process. This was a cheap and dirty solution. And not the reccomended method to fix an overheating PS3!

On COK-001 Motherboard revisions there is a backplate with four 1mm tall standoffs. This brace fits on the motherboard underneath. IT MUST BE 1mm! The model must be sanded down such that when the backplate goes back on, the brace DOES NOT ADD PRESSURE! THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. If there are any printing blobs or irregularitis that cause the brace to contact the backplate and add force underneath the die IT CAN CRACK THE DIE!
