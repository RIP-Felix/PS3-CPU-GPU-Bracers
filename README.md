# PS3-CPU-GPU-Bracers
On PS3 there is a backplate with four 1mm tall standoffs. This brace fits on the motherboard underneath. The various 3D models will allow you to make your own.

**WARNING** - If used to **restore coplanrity (flatness)** under the die, this brace is safe. However, **IT MUST BE 1mm**! The model must be sanded down such that when the backplate goes back on, the brace **DOES NOT ADD PRESSURE! THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT**. If there are any printing blobs or irregularitis that cause the brace to contact the backplate, it will add force underneath the die and **CRACK THE DIE** when the leaf springs are screwed back on! Do not punk out! Measure the thickness of the 3D model with calipers and **BE SURE** it cannot add pressure.

Let me be clear! The leaf springs are not losing force. The Paste is wearing out under the IHS! The motherboard is warping under the die because the 4 standoffs don't bridge the center. All this brace does is bridge the center! And it **MUST BE** be exactly 1mm to do so.

HOW TO USE - Place under the PlayStation 3's CPU/GPU backplate and keep the motherboard flat so it doesn't deform under the die. There are 3 versions that will work on most models of PS3 or the CPU. Crdit for the 65nm version goes to Shiiro and to Sampsonay for the 45nm version. I experimented with the Idea of making my own model for the RSX, which is harder because there are SMDs in that area and on each motherboard revision they're in a different place. The one included works on COK-001, but will need some modification after printing to fit. I may add more versions in the future, but we'll see.

BACKGROUND
Originally, SONY made and used these to restore contact between the Die and IHS, to avoid having to delid or replace the CPU. It restore contact with what little existing thermal paste is left. Even though the paste on the die is worn out and will fail again (who knows how soon), SONY's refirbishment centers did not delid. That's just not how they conduct repairs. They would have had to replace the CPU entirely, which is a difficult and expensive process. This brace was a cheap and dirty solution that kicked the ball down the road. It allwed them to send a console back and have it last beyond the 3 month warranty without overheating. And it's not the reccomended method to fix an overheating PS3!
